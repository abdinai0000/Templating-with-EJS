      <h2>Summary of the Book/ my Review</h2>    
      <p>Giovanna, a timid and obedient 12-year-old growing up in a middle-class neighborhood in Naples, overhears her father comparing her to his estranged sister Vittoria, who her parents had always described as someone whose "ugliness and nastiness were perfectly matched." His words trigger a series of events that disrupt Giovanna's life as she tries to uncover the reasons behind the family's rift.</p>    
      <p>The novel, published in Italy this month and set for release in English in June next year, was shrouded in secrecy until a surprise announcement in September. Some were concerned that the reclusive author's apparent "unmasking" in 2016 would hinder her ability to write fiction, but this is Ferrante's first new work since the hugely successful Neapolitan novels, which were published in Italy between 2011 and 2014 and were turned into a TV series named My Brilliant Friend last year. The book's publication was met with reading vigils all over Italy, with fans queuing up to buy copies at the stroke of midnight. It seems likely that a Ferrante cafe will soon open on the road where Giovanna lives, San Giacomo dei Capri, selling local fried snacks like panzerotti and pastacresciuta, which the protagonist and her father eat after school.</p>    
      <p>Ferrante is a master chronicler of adolescence and its many indignities, as well as its erratic, overwhelming passions, and she follows Giovanna's life from age 12 to 16, charting her transformation from a sweet girl who adores her parents to a sulking, aggressive teenager who finds pleasure in self-abasement and making those around her uncomfortable. She retains an extraordinary ability to capture the concerns and changing priorities of different ages, depicting the way strong feelings can fade and mutate with razor-sharp insights into the hypocrisies and muddled reasons that drive people's behavior.</p>
      <p>This book differs from Ferrante's previous works in that it focuses on the upper echelons of Neapolitan society in the early 1990s. Giovanna grows up in a wealthy leftwing household in which lively discussions about Marxism and the end of history are common, and she and her friends are given educational booklets about sex and taught to take pride in being female. But as Giovanna's quest for her mysterious aunt Vittoria leads her to discover a different Naples closer to the working-class rione of the previous books, she does her best to shed her privileged upbringing in favor of ill-considered liaisons with older men and a poorly pronounced, tentative Neapolitan dialect, often to humorous effect.</p>
      <p>As her seemingly idyllic family starts to disintegrate, Giovanna rebels further against her humanist, progressive parents by flirting with a belief in the supernatural and, thanks to a fateful church visit with Vittoria, religion. Tall, studious, curly-haired Roberto, reminiscent of the quartet's Nino Sarratore, delivers a sermon about compunction and becomes Giovanna's unattainable love interest. </p>
      <p>While the book shares themes with Ferrante's other works, such as a fascination with beauty (or the lack of it), class, and the ability to transcend poverty through education, and the contrast between vulgarity and refinement, there isn't a character who acts as a direct foil to the protagonist. Various female figures come and go without ever matching the rich character development afforded to Giovanna, who progresses from insecurity and painful self-analysis to an acceptance of sorts.</p>
